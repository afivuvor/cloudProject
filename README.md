# CloudProject: E-commerce Thrift Application for Environmental Sustainability

## Overview
CloudProject is a final-year project developed for a Cloud Computing class, aimed at promoting environmental sustainability through a thrift e-commerce platform. The application facilitates the exchange of pre-loved clothes between fashion enthusiasts and individuals looking to declutter their closets while earning some cash. Additionally, it educates users about the environmental impact of the textile industry through an about page displaying CO2 emissions data.

## Features
- **E-commerce Platform**: Users can browse, buy, and sell pre-loved clothes through the intuitive web interface.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures data privacy and enables personalized experiences.
- **Global CO2 Emissions Data**: The about page provides insights into the CO2 emissions of leading textile-producing countries, raising awareness about environmental sustainability.
- **Responsive Design**: The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure compatibility across various devices.
- **Backend with Flask**: The backend logic is implemented using Flask, providing robust server-side functionality.
- **MongoDB Database**: Data storage and retrieval are managed using MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
- **Docker Container Deployment**: The application is deployed using Docker containers for efficient management and scalability.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deployment is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, ensuring reliability and scalability.
